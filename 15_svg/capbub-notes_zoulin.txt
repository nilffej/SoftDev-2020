1
----- Predictions -----
HTML file contains a table
An alert will come up with what's inside a cell when clicked
----- Observations -----
Behaves as expected
Wondering how to change the alert title from "This page says"

2
----- Predictions -----
HTML file contains a table
Multiple alerts may come up since both rows and cells have event listeners
Clicking row might show all contents of row in single alert
I think the individual cell alert might take precedence over row alert
----- Obervations -----
Behaved as expected
Overlooked the whole table event listener
Also overlooked that the alert message would be actual HTML, did not pay attention to the innerHTML property
Messages appear in the order the event listeners are added

3
----- Predictions -----
HTML file contains a table
Uncommenting might stop following alerts
----- Observations -----
Overlooked the true parameter in table event listener
True argument appears to give it order priority
Uncommenting prediction is correct

4
----- Predictions -----
Order of event listeners does matter based on previous tests
Making a guess that since all event listeners have received the true argument, alerts might print reversed
Thinking stop propogation will still cut off alerts after one
----- Observations -----
Predictions were correct
